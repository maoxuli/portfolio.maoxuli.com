I built this site under the term of "portfolio" but you may find that it looks more like a blog. Yes, maybe I have listed too many trivial work that I have done (or been doing) during the past days, as a part of big project or just a piece of code for trial or testing purpose. Anyway, I hope this a kind of my footprints and you can find some interesting points. Good luck!

You may find me also somewhere else like <a href="https://github.com/maoxuli">Github</a>, <a href="http://linkedin.com/maoxuli">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com/maoxuli">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/maoxuli">Twitter</a>. And always you are welcome to send a message to me via email <a href="#">lim@gwu.edu</a>.
