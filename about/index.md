<h1>About this site</h1>

I built this site under the term of "portfolio" but you may find that it looks more like a blog. Yes, maybe I have listed too many trivial work that I have done (or been doing) during the past days, as a part of big project or just a piece of code for trial or testing purpose. Anyway, I hope this a kind of my footprints and you can find something interesting. Good luck!

<h1>About me</h1>

I am a senior C++ programmer. As usual I ever worked as a coder, a software architect, a project manager, and a director of software development, but the important thing is that I love to code. You are always welcome to leave a message in the <a href="/Guestbook">Guestbook</a>.
