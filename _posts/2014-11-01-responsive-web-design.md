I would like to declare that I am not a expert on web development, either design or programming. Even, I am not a qualified web developer at this moment. But I DO know some basis about HTML/CSS, Javscript, PHP, SQL/NoSQL, LAMP, and something else that I need to know to build my personal website. As any software programmer I am always interested in coding for my personal website, rather than laying on existing templates. And you guessed it, the outcome is usually neither personal nor perfect. But the most important thing is I enjoy this process and I learnt a lot always. 

I have maintained a website in terms of "portfolio" for several years, which have also evolved time to time, from static HTML pages, to wordpress based, and today it is based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. Just several days ago, I got my first smart phone (can you believe that?) and I found that it presents my website in a so ugly manner. I realized that it is time for me to do something for "mobile era".
